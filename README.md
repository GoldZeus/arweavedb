# ArweaveDB
ArweaveDB is used to write and read the arweave blockchain database.

Arweave uses an unique way of storing it's data, and this package can be used on servers or any other application that interacts with the blockchain.

ArweaveDB uses `fs` to write files and `fast-glob` to find blocks by height or by ID.
